				            	<p>Graeme Crawford, The founder of Reddam House started his career as a science teacher who noted that much more could be done to improve educational standards and the schooling experience.</p>
				            	<p>He envisaged his own school that could provide the ultimate in a rounded education through a dynamic new approach aimed at maximizing not purely the academic standard, but primarily the confidence, potential and individuality of each child.</p>
				            	<p>In 1992 his dream came to fruition when he created Crawford College. The school opened in January 1993 and was an immediate success, achieving outstanding academic results as well as major success in the cultural and sporting arenas.</p>
				            	<p>Swelling rapidly in size and with its new philosophy being widely spoken of and praised it was within two years the second Crawford Campus was to be born.</p>
				            	<p>Crawford Pretoria opened in 1994 and outstanding success was again demonstrated with the fledgling school obtaining results second only to Crawford in Johannesburg.</p>
				            	<p>Over the next 5 years Crawford Schools opened in Durban (Berea), Sandton, Lonehill, La Lucia, Fourways, Bryanston and the Natal North Coast. These schools consisted of pre-schools, primary and high schools. By 1999 over 6000 students were enrolled at Crawford Schools and over 600 teachers employed. Each was equally successful and the Crawford name became the benchmark for excellence in all the major centres around South Africa against which all other schools were judged and compared.</p>
				            	<p>After visiting Australia in April 1999 Graeme decided to relocate to Sydney to start a new life and a new school – Reddam House.</p>
				            	<p>Reddam House opened its doors in June,2000 and from that moment, brought a new age in learning and education to Australia’s shores.</p>
