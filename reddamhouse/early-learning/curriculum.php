				            	<p>The first years of any child’s life are crucial for his/her future development. Children grow not only physically, but in every area at this young age - emotionally, socially, intellectually and verbally. Appropriate guidance is vital to foster a well balanced and socialized child ready to face school and life. We aim to ensure our children leave the early years behind them as happy, confident and self-assured little individuals.</p>
				            	<p>Our early learning environment has been created, first and foremost, with a focus on nurturing your little ones in a warm, caring and loving atmosphere. To enhance this experience and make it as rewarding as possible, Reddam House has also purpose-designed a stimulating and imaginative learning programme that caters for both toddlers and pre-school children, in order to lay down a unique educational foundation that can be supported and developed in their subsequent years at Reddam.</p>
				            	<h6>Specialist Teachers</h6>
				            	<p>In addition to our independent and guided learning programme, the Early Learning School provides an enrichment programme. Taught by a range of specialist teachers, our learning programme incorporates dynamic, age-appropriate activities in the areas of Art, Music, Drama Enrichment, Computing, Foreign Language, Fitness, Nutrition, Jewish Studies, Bible studies and Manners/Interpersonal Skills.</p>
				            	<h6>Uniform</h6>
				            	<p>The Pre-School children in the Early Learning School have their very own ‘Multi-Form’. Designed with practicality and equality in mind, this gives the children the feeling of being part of the big school, not separate to it and makes them feel all grown up! The children are able to choose from a variety of items within the ‘Multi-Form’ range.</p>
				            	<p>Our Early Learning School prepares children best for a Reddam Education and Life.</p>
