When I'm not having a [bomb diggity time](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/austwo/) building [digital products](https://ustwo.com/blog/askies) with [ustwo](https://ustwo.com/what-we-do) I'm usually found lazing about in the park with a good book ([currently](http://english.lem.pl/works/novels/the-star-diaries)) or propping up the bar at my nearest [brewery](http://batchbrewingco.com.au/#ontap).

I built this site using my favourite static site generator, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). It's hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) because I ðŸ’– GitHub and it's just so easy.

### So what's with the name?

"Pretty much done": it's become a catch phrase of mine, and it's a bit of a jab at the naive optimism that I still have every time I embark on a new project.

You probably know the [80/20 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), and one of its principles says that for any task 80% of the work is done with about 20% effort. Which means that 80% of your effort is spent on 20% of the work. On a development project, that last 20% is make or break, it's either where the polish happens or where you find yourself in a nightmare of bugs.

Time after time I find myself (and others) saying a task is "pretty much done" and I have a chuckle, or maybe raise a red flag. Sometimes Pretty Much Done is just enough, sometimes its the harbinger of deadline doom. Knowing which is the case is where the fun starts.
