[Goodments](http://goodments.com/) is a young startup looking to shake up ethical investment in the stock market.

#### The opportunity

The team behind Goodments came to ustwo to find help with defining and testing their value proposition and product roadmap.

#### The solution

The ustwo team held a series of workshops and research exercises to define the product's value proposition audience and core features.

The result of the accelerator was a working product prototype that would serve to test the hypotheses that emerged from the team's research.

#### My role

I worked as a member of the product team to form a feasible prototype and help in the sizing of the full-scale solution. By chaining together existing systems and a thin front-end I was able to iterate on the prototype's logic with a minimum amount of waste.
