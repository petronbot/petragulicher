The Monkeys is an award-winning, independent creative agency located in Sydney. They produce outstanding work in advertising across TV, radio, outdoors & online.

#### The opportunity

Following a branding refresh in 2015 the agency needed a new look website and they needed it fast. The existing website had a wealth of content, but we wanted to present it in a new way that suited the updated branding.

#### The solution

Since we knew we had a short amount of time in which to work and a small team, we made a decision early on to leave all the content we had intact and instead focus on creating a new theme for our Wordpress CMS. Working mobile-first and content-first meant we could build up pages quickly to iterate on design.

Sticking to a well-practiced agile delivery process helped us focus our efforts on the most critical features first while keeping the wider team up to date with our progress at every step.

By implementing a design system that was minimal and consistent we were able to let the content shine through. We added some high-impact video and imagery, but by using lazy loading and other performance techniques we kept the page load fast.

#### My role

Working with a digital designer and agile coach, I developed and implemented a Wordpress theme and plugins as well as migrating the site's CMS and configuring a CDN and deployment. Sitting side-by-side with the team's designer meant that we could quickly test and iterate design ideas in the browser, with real content.
