The [Digital Transformation Agency](http://dta.gov.au) helps Australian Government departments and agencies make their online services clearer, faster & simpler. To do this, the <abbr title="Digital Transformation Agency">DTA</abbr> follows a [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/) that mandates a test-and-learn approach with an emphasis on shared learning and collaboration.

#### The opportunity

Teams across the <abbr title="Digital Transformation Agency">DTA</abbr> develop prototypes and production websites, and were re-creating styles and interfaces for every project. This meant extra effort working on problems that may have already been explored by other teams.

#### The solution

The Design Guide team was formed to gather all of the test outcomes and lessons learned and combine them into a set of design guidelines to be shared across all teams.

Working together with content writers, researchers and designers the Guides team developed a design system as well as guidance on how to implement accessible and cross-browser compatible markup.

The result was a [CSS framework](github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-ui-kit) and [Design Guide](https://github.com/AusDTO/dto-design-guide) which are used by teams across the <abbr title="Digital Transformation Agency">DTA</abbr> and beyond.

#### My role

As Lead Developer on the project team it was my responsibility to help workshop the technical needs of the solution, as well as steering technology choices that fit the profile and skills of the team. Being an open source project, there was a clear need to clearly communicate technical decisions and share them for discussion with our community of contributors.

Day to day on the project I'd be responsible for maintaining a high level of quality in the features that were added, as well as implementing a build system & deployment, automated accessibility testing and cross browser testing.
