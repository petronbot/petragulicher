Sometimes I can't stand the sound of my own voice, but I also enjoy sharing some of the things I've learnt in my career as a web developer.

When I get the opportunity I like to run workshops, teach and speak at meet-ups and workshops. If you'd like me to talk at your thing or if you'd just like to talk slide decks then [get in touch](/contact).
